    # Name template of the recipe

    name: jenkins-get-pr

    # # IDs of the archives to use.
    # # Defaults to all.
    # ids:
    # - foo
    # - bar

    # GOARM to specify which 32-bit arm version to use if there are multiple versions
    # from the build section. Brew formulas support atm only one 32-bit version.
    # Default is 6 for all artifacts or each id if there a multiple versions.
    goarm: '6'

    # NOTE: make sure the url_template, the token and given repo (github or gitlab) owner and name are from the
    # same kind. We will probably unify this in the next major version like it is done with scoop.

      # will be created. If no branch is listed, the default branch will be used
      branch: main

      # # Optionally a token can be provided, if it differs from the token provided to GoReleaser
      token: "{{ .Env.HOMEBREW }}"

    # Template for the url which is determined by the given Token (github or gitlab)
    # Default for github is "https://github.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/releases/download/{{ .Tag }}/{{ .ArtifactName }}"
    # Default for gitlab is "https://gitlab.com/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/-/releases/{{ .Tag }}/downloads/{{ .ArtifactName }}"

    # Default is empty.
    download_strategy: CurlDownloadStrategy

    # SPDX identifier of your app's license.
    # Default is empty.
    license: "MIT"

    # Setting this will prevent goreleaser to actually try to commit the updated
    # formula - instead, the formula file will be stored on the dist folder only,
    # leaving the responsibility of publishing it to the user.
    # If set to auto, the release will not be uploaded to the homebrew tap
    # in case there is an indicator for prerelease in the tag e.g. v1.0.0-rc1
    # Default is false.
    # skip_upload: auto


    # So you can `brew test` your formula.
    # Default is empty.
